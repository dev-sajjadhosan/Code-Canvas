# Code Canvas (cooking)

Assalamu Alaikum! Welcome to my personal collection of foundational projects built with the **core web technologies** — HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and TypeScript. This is a space where I demonstrate my growth and learning in front-end development through hands-on, real-world examples.

## Technologies

- Front-end

  - React
  - Tailwindcss
  - DaisyUi
  - React-icons
  -

- Back-end
  - NodeJs
  - ExpressJs
  -

## ✨ What's Inside

Each project highlights a specific concept or use case, built to reinforce my understanding of:

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and clean structure
- **CSS3**: Responsive layouts, modern styling, and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Dynamic behavior, DOM manipulation, and logic
- **TypeScript**: Type safety, interfaces, and cleaner code organization
- **Ui Designs**: only ui design, interfaces, wireframe

## 🧩 Project Categories

Projects are grouped by difficulty and scope:

- 🟢 **Beginner** – Simple, focused apps and components (e.g., calculators, forms)
- 🟡 **Intermediate** – Functional UI elements and interactive designs
- 🔴 **Professional** – More complete mini-projects with TypeScript and structure
- 🔵 **More** - if possible **Normal**,**Medium**,**Hard** projects will also show

## 🚀 How to Explore

You can view all the new projects in a horizontal carousel interface with smooth scrolling. Each card links to the source or a live preview (if available).
